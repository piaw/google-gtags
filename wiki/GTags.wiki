=Google Tags (GTags)=

Google Tags is a project to speed up code browsing in large
source code base. Here are some scenarios where it can help:

   * While you're browsing source code, Gtags can immediately jump to the definition of a function or variable.
   * Gtags can grep over all definitions or function calls in Google source code.
   * Gtags can tell you where all the callers of a particular function are.

We do this by extending the TAGS functionality in GNU Emacs and
XEmacs. A separate server-side component answers requests for particular tags
and returns a set of matching results for each.

We provide an [GTagsEmacsClient Emacs client], a
[GTagsShellClient command-line client], and a [GTagsVIClient VI client].
We also provide a [GTagsPythonClient Python API].
